# ManagerTalk — Difficult Conversation Coach

> A scenario-based coaching application that helps managers practice sensitive workplace conversations through structured, interactive simulations.

ManagerTalk provides a realistic, guided environment for developing **clarity, empathy, accountability, and communication skills** in challenging workplace situations.

---

##   Overview

ManagerTalk allows managers to practice difficult conversations in a safe, repeatable environment before having them in real life.

Each scenario follows a structured **7-step conversation model**, guiding the participant from understanding the situation through to commitments, closing, and feedback.

##   Included Scenarios

### MT-S01 — The Passed-Over Performer

A senior analyst expected a promotion but didn't receive it.

Following the decision, their performance has declined and trust between the employee and manager has become strained.

The manager must navigate the conversation while addressing:

* Performance concerns
* The employee's expectations
* Emotional impact
* Trust
* Accountability
* Future commitments

This scenario is designed to test the manager's ability to balance **empathy with accountability**.

---

### MT-S02 — The Stage-Machine Scenario

An advanced scenario built around a **state machine** for precise behavioural transitions and branching conversation logic.

The scenario demonstrates how structured state management can be used to model complex conversation flows and behavioural outcomes.

---

#   The 7-Step Conversation Model

ManagerTalk uses a structured seven-stage conversation framework.

### 1. Scenario Overview

Provides the manager with the context and objectives for the conversation.

### 2. Performance SBI

Uses the **Situation → Behaviour → Impact** structure to establish clear, observable performance feedback.

### 3. Exploration

Encourages the manager to explore the employee's perspective rather than immediately jumping to conclusions.

### 4. Hypotheses

Allows the manager to consider possible explanations for the employee's behaviour or performance.

### 5. Commitments

Moves the conversation toward specific actions and expectations.

### 6. Closing

Summarises the discussion and establishes clarity around next steps.

### 7. Scoring & Feedback

Provides feedback on the conversation and highlights areas for improvement.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Screen State Navigation

ManagerTalk does not use React Router.

Instead, navigation is controlled through a lightweight **screen state machine**.

This keeps the application's navigation model simple because the application follows a relatively controlled workflow.

---

### Scenario Progress Autosave

Scenario progress is automatically persisted so that users can leave and return to a scenario without losing their progress.

The application restores saved progress when the scenario is reopened.

---

### Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication is responsible for the user's authentication identity and session management.

Authentication identity is intentionally kept separate from the user's certificate identity.

---

### Firestore Profile Persistence

User-specific profile information is stored in Firestore.

For example:

```text
users/{uid}.certificateName
```

The certificate name is loaded before the application renders the relevant user experience.

---

#   Profile & Certificate Name

Users can configure the name they want to appear on their completion certificate.

The selected certificate name is:

* Stored in Firestore
* Associated with the authenticated user's UID
* Hydrated when the application starts
* Used when generating certificates
* Preserved across devices and browsers

### Firestore Structure

```text
users/
  {uid}/
    certificateName: "User's Chosen Name"
```

If no certificate name has been configured, ManagerTalk falls back to:

```text
ManagerTalk Participant
```

---

#   Certificate of Completion

After successfully completing a scenario, the user receives a certificate of completion.

The certificate includes:

* Certificate name
* Scenario ID
* Completion date

The certificate is rendered directly within the application.

The certificate name is dynamically populated using the user's profile information.

#  AI-Assisted Development

ManagerTalk was developed through an AI-assisted workflow that supported rapid iteration and refinement across 
both the product and development process, while all final architectural, engineering, and product 
decisions remained developer-controlled.
---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before running ManagerTalk locally, make sure you have:

* Node.js installed
* npm installed
* A Firebase project
* Firebase Authentication configured
* Firestore configured

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

Add your Firebase configuration:

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```

> Do not commit your `.env` file or other sensitive configuration to source control.

---

## Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start in development mode.

---

## Type Check

Run the TypeScript compiler without generating output:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Production Build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

---

# 🔥 Firebase Setup

ManagerTalk uses Firebase for authentication and profile persistence.

The application requires:

### Firebase Authentication

Used for:

* User authentication
* Session management
* User identity

### Firestore

Used for:

* User profile persistence
* Certificate name storage
* User-specific application data

The Firebase configuration is supplied through environment variables.

# 🧩 Design Principles

ManagerTalk was designed around several principles:

### Practice Before Performance

Managers can rehearse difficult conversations without the consequences of a real workplace conversation.

### Structure

A consistent conversation framework helps users focus on specific communication behaviours.

### Repeatability

Scenarios can be practiced repeatedly, allowing users to refine their approach.

### Accountability + Empathy

The scenarios are designed to encourage managers to balance clear performance expectations with genuine exploration of the employee's perspective.

### Separation of Concerns

Authentication, profile persistence, scenario state, navigation, and certificate rendering are kept as separate application concerns.
